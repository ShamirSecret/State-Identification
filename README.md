# State Identification
State Identification technology serves as a bridge service between Web2 and Web3, leveraging state channel technology and contract trust mechanisms. It provides multi-signature for every off-chain transaction, offering services and APIs to numerous Web2 projects, assisting them in interacting with any blockchain effortlessly. This technology also reduces the distrust users may have towards centralized servers.
