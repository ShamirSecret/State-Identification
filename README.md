# State Identification
State Identification is a Web3 public good developed for Massive Adoption based on state channel technology. It facilitates project teams in deploying and interacting with on-chain contracts, and safeguards user assets through on-chain contracts to prevent malicious actions by the project team and reduce losses when the project team's server is attacked.
